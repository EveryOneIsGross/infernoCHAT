# infernoCHAT
## Description
This project implements a chatbot that allows users to explore and interact with the denizens of Dante's Inferno. The chatbot provides a simulated conversation experience with various levels of Inferno, each represented by a different embodiement of sin. Users can choose a level, chat with the bot representing that level, and explore the unique characteristics and experiences of each level in Dante's Inferno. You are accompanied by the great poet Virgil.

## Dante's Inferno Philosophies and their Relationship to the Program
The program you are using is based on Dante's Inferno, a renowned literary work by Dante Alighieri. This section will provide an overview of the philosophies explored in Dante's Inferno and their connection to the program you are interacting with.

Overview of Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno is the first part of the epic poem Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century. It describes an allegorical journey through Hell, guided by the poet Virgil. Dante, the protagonist, traverses nine concentric circles of Hell, each representing a specific sin or transgression.

Philosophies Explored in Dante's Inferno
1. The Divine Justice of Punishment
Dante's Inferno reflects the concept of divine justice, where sinners are appropriately punished according to the severity of their offenses. Each level of Hell represents a particular sin, and the punishments are meticulously designed to reflect the nature of the transgressions committed.

2. The Moral Hierarchy of Sins
Dante categorizes sins into different levels within Hell, depicting a moral hierarchy. The sins range from lesser offenses, such as lust and gluttony, to more severe transgressions like violence and treachery. This hierarchy emphasizes the varying degrees of moral depravity.

3. The Nature of Sin and its Consequences
Dante's Inferno explores the consequences of sinful actions. It portrays how indulging in base desires and straying from moral virtue leads to a state of suffering and eternal damnation. Each sin in Inferno highlights the destructive nature of human vices and the eternal repercussions they entail.

4. Personal Responsibility and Redemption
Through the journey in Inferno, Dante encounters various sinners who are remorseful for their actions. This highlights the theme of personal responsibility and the possibility of redemption. The program's depiction of different levels and interactions with the sinners offers opportunities to reflect on the importance of personal choices and the potential for transformation.

5. Symbolism and Allegory
Dante's Inferno utilizes rich symbolism and allegorical representations. The various creatures, landscapes, and punishments in each level of Hell symbolize deeper meanings and moral lessons. Exploring these symbols and their significance can provide valuable insights into human nature, morality, and spirituality.

## Interface

User Input: Enter your desired input or message as a response to the provided prompt. The chat interface will interpret and process your input to generate a suitable response.

Basic Commands:

descend: Use the command "descend" to progress to the next level or descend further into the depths of Inferno.
reset: If you wish to start from the beginning or reset your progress, enter the command "reset".
exit: To quit the chat interface, type "exit" or any other suitable command specified by the interface.
virgil: using "virgil yourquestion" will get a response from your guide Virgil. Typing "virgil" will display their description.

Engaging in Conversation: The chat interface utilizes artificial intelligence to generate responses based on the level and character you are interacting with. Feel free to engage in conversation, ask questions, seek information, or discuss topics related to the specific level of Inferno.

Switching Characters: Depending on your project setup, you may have the option to switch characters or interact with different entities within Dante's Inferno. Follow any provided instructions or specific commands to switch between characters, such as "virgil" to communicate with VirgilBot.

Continuation: Continue the conversation by providing meaningful and relevant input, exploring different aspects of Dante's Inferno, or following the narrative and prompts presented by the chat interface.

## To Do

- add diaglogue from the original work to Virgil
- add local JSON memories for levels and virgil
- replace atmosphere tag with sentiment analysis to adjust temperature, token limit and to contextually add positive or negative alignments to their output
- refactor and seperate out logic
